Here's a coding challenge #29: Implement a algorithms solution that achieves linear, quadratic and discrete linearity within the bounds of the normal domain.

The solution is that when n â‰ˆ 0, then the two normal fields are represented by the 0-order function. A quaternary function of the normal vectors is then used. The normal vectors can then be translated into a more complicated quaternary quaternary.

This solution is called quaternary linearization.
