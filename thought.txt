Here's a coding challenge #39: Implement a deep learning solution that works with a single machine learning algorithm. With the most recent release, it will become easy and time-consuming to create any machine learning solution for every task. There are already some good examples.

What's going on here? I really don't know and I did some research on this and it's good to mention that with this approach in mind, we should have a better understanding of how a machine learning algorithm can help
