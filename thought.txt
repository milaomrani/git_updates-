Here's a coding challenge #42: Implement a machine learning solution that allows you to quickly solve more abstract problems without needing to rely on the "learning" algorithm. This code is written with a few tricks and features to help you make it work.

The first section covers the following three steps:

Pick your initial algorithm (if applicable) and then assign one more feature. Select a task for which the default AI could run, and then set a condition. See the "Model-
