Today's number is 16. This makes me think about: How would that number have played out if there had been less support for Trump? Would Trump's election success also be less impressive if the campaign had more polling? Do you think polls matter? Do you feel more pressure to believe in Trump than if nothing happened? Would any of that influence the outcome of the election? We'd need to make an informed decision as to who comes to the White House and who will be named CEO.
