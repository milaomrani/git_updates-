AI concept #47: Understanding data structures and its applications in computer vision

Abstract: The understanding of data structures is an important question in understanding the evolution of computer vision. This paper addresses some of these issues by asking a fundamental question-do they have any application in computing? In this work we propose to show that computer vision is uniquely possible because the computational capabilities of the computer-generated image are truly beyond what any general application would require. This provides a framework to demonstrate computational capabilities of the computer
