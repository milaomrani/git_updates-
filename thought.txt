AI concept #41: Understanding software design and its applications in the field of software design. This paper tries to define a 'technomic layer' that might be relevant to a new kind of system (a human-machine hybrid): a 'brain control system' or 'brain-control system without hardware.' Our aim is to gain an insight into the mind's state-of-the-art in software design with reference to the field of computer science (Bristol, 1989).
